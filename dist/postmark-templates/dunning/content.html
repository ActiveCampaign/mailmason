              <h2>Why did the payment fail?</h2>
              <p>In most cases, a payment might fail because:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>The card expired</li>
                <li>There are insufficient funds</li>
                <li>The payment needs additional authentication before we can process it.</li>
              </ul>

              <p class="u-margin-bottom-none">You can see more details on your recent order and why the payment failed on the <a href="{{invoice_url}}">invoice page</a>.</p>
            </div>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>

<p>We’ll try charging your card again in [x] days and let you know if the payment is successful.</p>

<p>If you have any questions or need our help, you can reach our support team at [email address] or just reply to this email.</p>
